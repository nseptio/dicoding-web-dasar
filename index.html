						<h2 class="subheading">Profile</h2>
						<section>
							<h3 class="subsection-heading">Introduction</h3>
							<p class="article-content">One of the three presidents of the Tea Party, Trinity's student
								council, and
								the
								leader of the Filius
								Faction. Nagisa is also Mika's childhood friend. In contrast to Mika, Nagisa thinks
								first before acting,
								sometimes thinking a bit too much to the point where she causes problems for others who
								are uninvolved
								or
								are supposed to be considered innocent. Compared to the other Tea Party members,
								Nagisa's political
								prowess seems to be the highest.

								She enjoys preparing tea leaves and sweets for the Tea Party, and many students are
								dreaming of the day
								when they'll be invited to the Tea Party, which is ironic since the Tea Party was
								supposed to revolve
								around social gatherings, yet Nagisa never invited many people.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h3 class="subsection-heading">Personality</h3>
							<p class="article-content">Nagisa is quite calm and composed, but like everyone else, she
								has her limit,
								and
								she can get quite
								ruthless once someone breaks her composure. She also tends to overthink things which can
								sometimes end
								up
								causing trouble for other people. Even Sensei called her cynical due to her paranoic
								behavior.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h3 class="subsection-heading">Appearance</h3>
							<p class="article-content">Nagisa has long ash blonde hair with flower ornaments stretching
								from the top
								of
								her head to her left
								ear. On her back are a pair of angel wings that sprouts out from the waist.</p>
							<section>
								<h4>Halo</h4>
								<p class="article-content">Her halo consists of a red circle, that has ten thorns
									sticking out of it.
									Every other thorn is
									thinner, and has a semi-circle base. They also merge with the circle, unlike the
									rest.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h4>
									Uniform
								</h4>
								<p class="article-content">She wears a mid-length, cream skirt dress, with golden
									buttons, and accents
									around the edges of the
									skirt. The inner side of the skirt is navy. On top of this, she wears her Tea Party
									capelet with
									similar
									design, tied with a dark grey bow. Below her bosom, she has a belt, which holds a
									pistol holster. For
									legwear, she has a pair of dark grey pantyhose, and white high heels.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h4>Firearm</h4>
								<p class="article-content">She uses a white Walther PPK pistol with a pink lower slide
									and grip. The
									Trinity insignia is imprinted
									on the grip. Her name is stamped on the front slide.

									For her EX Skill, she commands a battery of L118 Light Guns.</p>

							<section>
								<h4>Misono Mika</h4>
								<p class="article-content">A childhood friend who has known each other for around 10 years. Mika is also
									a president of the Tea Party alongside her. Although they both are quite the opposites when it comes
									to their personalities, they still kept their bond as friends, even after the events that happened in
									Volume 3.</p>

								<h3 class="subsection-heading">Supplementary Lessons Department</h3>
								<section>
									<h4>Ajitani Hifumi</h4>
									<p class="article-content">Nagisa seems to have a liking towards Hifumi, although her exact reasons
										are still unclear. Even though Nagisa was forced to put Hifumi in the Supplementary Lessons
										Department and risk getting her expelled from Trinity to confirm her suspicions, she still showed
										major concern and sympathy towards Hifumi.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h4>
										Shirasu Azusa
									</h4>
									<p class="article-content">During V3C2E15, Azusa knocked Nagisa out inside her safehouse under
										Hanako's orders by releasing a whole magazine worth of bullets onto her to keep her quiet.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h4>
										Urawa Hanako
									</h4>
									<p class="article-content">During V3C2, Hanako played a big role in keeping Arius away as it was
										mostly thanks to the plan she devised that Arius was able to be stopped. Part of this plan is
										keeping Nagisa quiet, which is exactly what she ordered Azusa to do. Right before Nagisa was knocked
										out, Hanako teased her a bit by saying that Hifumi is no longer friends with her.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3 class="subsection-heading">Supplementary Lessons Department</h3>
									<section>
										<h4>Utazumi Sakurako</h4>
										<p class="article-content">During V3C4E2, Sakurako uninvitedly joined a personal meeting held by
											Nagisa specifically for Sensei to talk about what happened after the Arius incident, causing the
											atmosphere to turn awkward.</p>
									</section>

								<section>
									<h3 class="subsection-heading">Knights Hospitaller</h3>
									<section>
										<h4>Aomori Mine</h4>
										<p class="article-content">During V3C4E2, Mine also joined Nagisa's personal meeting held
											specifically for Sensei regarding the aftermath of the Arius incident, disrupting the previously
											normal atmosphere.</p>
									</section>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3 class="subsection-heading">Schale</h3>
									<section>
										<h4>Sensei</h4>
										<p class="article-content">During Volume 3, Nagisa asked Sensei to help with guiding the
											Supplementary Lessons Department. Eventually, Sensei found out about Nagisa's intentions and
											decided to help them their own way, causing Nagisa to alter multiple factors that would make
											Sensei's job much more difficult.</p>

						<ul class="trivia-list article-content">
							<li><span>Nagisa is the second student to get a design change after her original design was
									already
									released. The first one is Kazusa.</span></li>
							<ul>
								<li><span>Her design change was given during Volume F's release.</span></li>
							</ul>
							<li><span>Coincidentally, Nagisa shares the same birthday as America's Independence Day
									although she was
									supposed to resemble Britain and its traditions, hence the tea and sweets</span>
							</li>
							<li><span>
									Her JP banner uses an English title instead of the usual JP titles: "Where there's
									Tea Party, there's
									hope."
								</span></li>
							<li><span>Kiri (桐) and Fuji (藤) flowers are both associated with images of nobility in
